                <p>Hi, I'm Darragh Mahns. I am a software engineer living in Denver, CO. I'm enrolled
                    in my last three classes at the University of Denver right now where I will be 
                    graduating in August.</p>
                <p>While at DU, I stayed wuite busy, competing and training as part of the varsity 
                    swim team while completing a challenging degree. On top of this, I always had a 
                    job.</p>
                <p> I enjoy working on projects and learning how things work and how to do more than 
                    I know how and am excited to do so in a more non-academic environments. I can work in many 
                    languages and understand many different tools which are listed below or built in to my 
                    projects.</p>
